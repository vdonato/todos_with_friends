# todos_with_friends

This is a project originally written for a Streamlit company hackathon that
ended up being a very contrived toy project built to fit in as many features 
that we were beta testing during the hackathon as possible.

The project is a JS-framework-tutorial-style TODO list app built in streamlit
that also has the ability to provide you with Markov-generated suggestions for
things to do. The Markov model is originally trained on titles of our GitHub
issues (as of late January 2021), and it gets updated as the user submits more
and more things to their TODO list.

The "with friends" part is misleading and came from the original idea I had for
this that ended up being scrapped :neutral_face:.
